## How do we predict a potential match in dating?

This was a group project for course PY 895:Machine Learning for Physicists taught by Prof.Pankaj Mehta. 
I was one of the two contributors.

In the project, I used the speed dating experiment data compiled by Prof.Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar [1].
I trained a logistic regression model that achieved 82% accuracy in predicting a match.
I also found that there existed gender difference in mate selection.

v2 is the final version submitted.
